# `fide-ratings-json`

[FIDE makes its rating lists available for download](https://ratings.fide.com/download_lists.phtml) in text and XML format.

This repository contains scripts that track these upstream FIDE rating lists, convert them to JSON, and organize them by country. [See `dist/`](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/fide-ratings-json/tree/main/dist) for the resulting output.
